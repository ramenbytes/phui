#+TITLE: GUI-README

* Hi!
Everything is still in flux right now. Checkout [[gui.org]] for an overview of my
current focuses and thoughts. It's more of a scratchpad than proper
documentation though.

* File Purposes
[[point-n-shoot.py]] is responsible for providing a unified, streamlined conversion
interface for files and is just a thin layer over phconvert. While it is being
developed for use in the phconvert user interface, it may be useful for
programmatic conversion as well.
