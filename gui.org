#+TITLE: Gui
* Overview
Creating GUI for [[https:https://github.com/Photon-HDF5/phconvert][phconvert]] to make things more accessible to
non-programmers/non-technical people who aren't familiar/comfortable with the
way things are currently done with the command line and/or code.
* Maya's Feature Suggestions/Requests
** Convert files with gui
Baseline behavior and reason for existence. The tool needs to allow the user to
convert files with phconvert.
** Batch conversion
Maya mentioned allowing the user to convert multiple files at once, like
converting all the files in a directory.
** Generating metadata yaml file
Maya mentioned allowing the user to specify that the yaml file accompanying each
hdf5 file. Without some of the data from this file, the data is rather useless.
Said there are a set number of fields allowed in the data file (now, will that
change?). From phconvert's docs, certain fields are required.
